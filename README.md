# Mini-project
A web based application to connect farmers to fruit juice manufacturing industries.
The fruit crop production in Ghana is mainly dominated by smallholder farmers who cultivate fruits on small farms. The government has implemented several policies and programs to support fruit crop production in the country, including the Planting for Export and Rural Development (PERD) initiative, which seeks to promote the cultivation of selected crops, including fruits, for export.

About 45 % of the countryâ€™s labor force are engaged in agriculture with about 20% into fruit and vegetable farming . Despite these large labor force in fruit and vegetable farming, the European Union continues to be the major importer of Ghanaian fruits, notably in France, Belgium, Morocco, Lebanon, Switzerland, and Germany. 

This is because most produce of the Ghanaian farmer do not meet the criteria or requirements needed by these juice  manufacturing companies. The demand for fresh fruits, such as pineapples, is very high, mostly for exports, traditional domestic markets, supermarkets, and fruit processing. There is also a growing demand for fresh fruits for use in processed products, juices, etc., for local consumption and export. According to a study on the mordorintelligence website, the  Ghanaian fruits and vegetable market is projected to register a compound annual growth rate of 6% within the forecast period 2022-2027. To help with this growth plan and eventually achieve it, we  need a comprehensive digital platform that can connect farmers to fruit juice manufacturing companies. A platform that will  demonstrate commitment to small farms, reduce anxieties about uncertain markets and create a loyal customer base

This project aims to create a seamless and efficient system that benefits both parties. The agricultural sector is a vital part of our economy, and fruit production is a significant contributor to this sector. However, many fruit farmers face challenges in meeting the right requirements of juice manufacturing industries. On the other hand, fruit juice manufacturing companies often struggle to source high-quality fruits in the quantities they require.

Our proposed solution is to develop a system that connects these two groups through a digital platform. The system will enable fruit farmers to showcase their produce and connect with fruit juice manufacturing companies that require their fruits. This platform will create a win-win situation for both parties, as farmers can gain access to a larger market  and reduce post-harvest loses while juice manufacturers can source high-quality fruits.
